# LOG OF MAIN EVENTS (from recent to past)

2024-1004 to 2024-1018 solved the follwing issues:
- merged pull request #58 to solve enhancement issue 'copy neu params yaml in output dir' #57
- solved enhancement issue #55: added a directory neu_models_catalogue hosting interesting neural configurations
- solved bug #51 furter restringing the analysis window in _crop_and_plot.yaml
- removed unnecessarily tracke overwrite_output directory
- merged pull request #50 solving issue #45 add-actions-to-switch-on-plasticity-set-learning-parrameters-and-disconnect-synapses. 
- merged pull request #48 solving BUG issue #47: rates and spectral analysis for short analysis durations #47
- merged pull request #46 solving BUG issue #32: measure of firing rate when a pop has zero spikes in the time window.
- #43 specify plasticity default parameters in config file
- #39 Add first approximation of background recurrency (can set inter_assemblies connectivity to existing (True) or non existing (False))
and attibute initial values for the weights in ...general_config.yaml files
- #40 introduce flexible sparsity in synaptic matrices, added pairwise_bernolli connectivity, with programmable p_conn_exc and p_conn_inh values (defaulting to 1.0, i.e. all_to_all)

Release 2024-1002 solving issue #37  "Several issues related to Ca-AdEx calibration and plasticity management": addition of adaptation conductance, list of receptor names, learning rate settings, naming kinds of synapses and solving issue create dictionary book keeping the present kind of intra pop synapses #34

Release 2024-0912 solving issue #26 use recurrency false

Release 2024-0822 solving issue #19 switch on plasticity and #23: Added capability of disconnecting intra assemblies connections at programmable time, and what target exc pop to be disconnected

Release 2024-0820b config and plots can be saved in directories that can be specified using the file "directories_and_list_of_yamls.yaml".
Use there the "overwrite_dir" file name if you want to send last runs always to the same directory.

Release 2024-0820 Solution of issue #16. It is now possible to specify a list of events during the simulation. The first supported action is the saving of intra assembly synaptic matrices at times that can be defined in the basic_ and tune_sim_and_recording_times.yaml files

Release 2024-0817 It Solves both issue #11 and issue #12. Now the main launches a single activity analysis function. 
All parameters for the analysis and the plot of the activity can be set in the basic_ and tune_ crop_and_plot.yaml files.

Commit 2024-0817 Solving issue #12 create crop_and_plot yaml files

Release 2024-0816 Solving issue #9: "encapsulate the first part of the main in a nest_parameters_preparation() function"

Release 2024-0808 Solving issue #5: "Add basic contextual signal reaching a single assembly with a start and stop time"it is the product of branch: "#5-add-basic-contextual-signal..."

Release 2024-0807 introduced multicompartment support solving issue#3: "Support for runs with both single and multi-compartment neurons"

Release 2024-0510 Added capability of spectral analysis with error bands, by pull request #1 that solves issue #2: "Need for spectral analysis with error band and detection of maxima"

2024-0430: novel features:
- all parameters stored in reference yaml files
- all parameters can be tuned reading additional "tune_..." yaml files 
- nest network creation and simulation in separate file
